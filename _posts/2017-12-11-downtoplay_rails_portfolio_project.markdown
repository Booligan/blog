DownToPlay is a web app that connects people by setting up local pick up games. Users set up a profile, and from there they have the ability to join or plan games of their own.

This Rails project was definitely the most challenging so far, but it also felt amazing once it was completed. And it was not just the feeling of relief knowing that I had knocked another project off the list. I was amazed as to how far I’ve come in this journey. I went from knowing nothing about how websites are developed, to now developing one of my own.

For this app, I tried my best to make it look aesthetically pleasing as possible. In the curriculum we focus more on the back-end side, but a website is not complete to me unless it looks as good as it works. So I reviewed a BUNCH of CSS and HTML, and watched hours of YouTube videos to make the app visually appealing. I didn’t use Bootstrap, but I definitely want learn more of it soon. Hopefully for the next project.

The hardest part for me was incorporating all the requirements needed. We covered a lot of material, so I had to constantly review previous lessons.

I happy with with I created, and now am excited to start JavaScript.
