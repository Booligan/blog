I can't believe it's a little over two months since I have started the online program. I remember how overwhelmed I felt when starting HTML/CSS and OO Ruby, and to how comfortable I feel with it now. I'll admit that I need a little refresher on HTML and CSS, but overall I feel like I am in a good position. It is this memory of unease and frustration that helped me push through the following topic, Sinatra. This topic covers so much, that it becomes hard to keep things in your long term memory, so I had to frequently go back to read previous lessons. Thinking back to times where I felt lost with OO Ruby, helped me realize that I too can become comfortable with Sinatra just like I did with OO Ruby.

Before we jumped into Sinatra, we had to learn the fundamentals: SQL, ORM, ActiveRecord, Rack. You can imagine how overwhlemed I was when finally learning Sinatra. I literally felt like I was starting bootcamp all over again with all of the new syntax. I was constantly reaching out for help with Tech coaches. I think my most difficult topic to wrap my head around was associations. I just could not understand the many-many relationship. It wasn't until I read this article, http://www.joinfu.com/2005/12/managing-many-to-many-relationships-in-mysql-part-1/, that it started to clear up a bit. A seperate table is needed to associate many objects to other objects.

When I completed the NYC-Sinatra, and Playlister labs, I still did not feel fully comfortable with my knowledge. I'd say it was maybe a 6/10. Because of this I decided to tackle the Fwitter project on my own, to serve as a refresher. This made me reencounter problems that I had with the previous labs. Solving these issues and ultimately finishing the project rose my knowledge to a 8/10, which I am very happy with. Now I just have to think about what to base my Sinatra final project on, hmmmmmm.
