When I was in college, I remember cruising by my programming classes with so much confidence, thinking that I would be the next Mark Zuckerberg. That is until I reached Object Orientatition. This type of programming felt so foreign to me, and after months of basic linear programming, I could not adjust to the change and felt hopeless. This however, should not be the case, because in reality, an OO design helps you visualize real world scenarios. This alone, helps in the flow of code, and makes programming so much easier to read and write.

What is an Object?

When you think about objects, you should visualize any tangible or intangible thing that has attributes and/or behaviors. For example, a Person, Dog, Concert, Bank Account. In a Person object, we can give it attributes such as name, age, eye color. We can also give it behavaior to introduce themselves. 

Alberto = Person.new
Alberto.name = "Alberto"
Alberto.age = 26
Alberto.eye_color = "brown"

Alberto.introduce_yourself
*(OUTPUT: "Hello, my name is Alberto. I am 26 years old, and I have brown eyes.")*

See how nice that looks! It's like you're are physically talking to your code and telling Alberto to introduce himself. The moment that I was able to visualizing objects as real world things and not just a line of code, it made the concept so much easier to learn.
