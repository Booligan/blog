The first thing we see when we open a webpage is blocks of text, images, videos, etc scattered through out the page, but what you may not notice is the Page Layout, which meshes eveything beautifully. Think of a blank webpage as an empty room that needs to be furnished. Let's say we buy a bed, a dresser, a nightstand, etc. We know where we want to place each inidividual item to satisfy our taste, or Room *Layout*. This is exactly what happens in Page Layout. We have objects of texts or images, etc, that we place to fit the desired style.

Check out the (outdated) Apple page layout above. I can break the layout into 3 different sections.

1. Header
2. Body
3. Footer 

The header is seen as a banner of menu items, containing the Apple logo, Store link, Mac link, and more.

The body is the main advertisement of the page, the iMac image with a small caption on the bottom. Followed by a few smaller advertisements underneath them.

The footer are the small links at the bottom such as, Contact us, and Job Opportunities.

We use CSS to control the height, width, and postion of each object on the page. CSS is our tool to give our Page layout a sleek, and professional look.
