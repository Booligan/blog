I graduated with a B.S in Computer Science in 2015, and like many graduates of computer science, I decided to pursue a career in Software Development. Unfortunely there was one major issue holding me back; my inability to code. Now, I wasn't completey oblivious (I learned basics in C++ and VB), but I knew that I was not ready for the work force. I still wanted to stay in the I.T field, and was lucky enough to get a job doing I.T support at my current employer. I can say that I'm fairly content at my job, but I very frequently imagine myself coding. This desire was the catalyst that made me realize that just because I was out of college, it did not mean that I couldn't learn to code.

Around June 2017, I started taking some free courses online, a mixture of Code Academy, Kahn Academy, and some YouTube videos. I found that my biggest struggles were time, and STRUCTURE. I needed a curriculum that I could follow that made me feel comfortable that I was learing the correct material.

A friend of mine suggested coding bootcamps and MOOC's (Massive Open Online Courses). I had heard of these before, but wasn't completey sold on them yet. It turns out that this was exactly what I needed! 

I researched a few MOOC's and coding bootcamps in my area, NJ/NY. This was when I found the Flatiron School Full Stack Web Development program. I was able to keep my job, and learn to code on my free time.

I've been in the program for about 3 weeks now, and I love it! There are ups and downs of course, but each day I get a little better. I know that when I finish the bootcamp I'll be prepared for a career in coding.
