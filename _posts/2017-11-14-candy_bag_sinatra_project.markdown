Round 2 of projects is now complete, and I feel that it was a success. I will say that the jump from OO Ruby and the CLI project to Sinatra was huge. Lots of material was covered(and re-read to fully understand). Overall, it was a very fun project. One that starts taking baby steps toward developing sophisticated websites.

Honestly, the hardest part for me was thinking of an idea. I had already used a soccer theme for my CLI project, so I put my soccer fever aside and kept thinking. After about 3 hours, I had an idea! Being that Halloween was just a few weeks ago, I thought maybe I can revolve my project on a medium where kids can keep inventory of their Halloween candy, and also compare it with their friends. I wasn’t completely sold on the idea, but it was a start. I laid out a sheet of paper, and *tried* to write out my models and associations. Luckily for me the Sinatra Playlister lab was very similar to the associations that I needed. So I used it as a template.

Now it was time to set up my environment to code. In comes Corneal! Corneal, developed by a fellow Flatiron student is a wonderful gem that sets all of this up for you. Simply by running gem install corneal and corneal new candybag, I was ready to code.

The biggest thing that helped me was adding styling to the pages. With the previous labs, I was kind of lost with how the pages were interacting with each other. So I reviewed a little bit of CSS, and mostly just googled and messed around with my layout. I was very satisfied with my results.

With the styling and dummy links in place, I slowly worked to getting each one to work. After about 2 fulls days of work, I was done. I also deployed it on Heroku! Feel free to take a look at: candybag.herokuapp.com

Now onto Rails! :)
